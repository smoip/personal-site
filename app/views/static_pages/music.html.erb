  <h1>Music</h1>
  <p>Music has and always will be a driving force in my life, and my education
    in composition has lead me to engage with it in a number of ways: writing music (of course),
    but also writing about music, organizing concerts and events, recording and
    mastering, and designing crazy electronic instruments (which dovetails
    nicely with my work in software).</p>

  <p>I have written music for all kinds of ensembles and instrumentations (everything
    from serious concert music to pop tunes and video game arrangements), but I have a soft
    spot for string-driven chamber music and focus mainly on pieces involving electronics in some capacity.</p>
  <p>Below are a few of my current projects.</p>

  <h2>Selected Projects</h2>
