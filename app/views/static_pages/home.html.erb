  <h1>About Me</h1>
  <%= image_tag("david_face.jpg", alt: "David Roberts", class: "img-float-left") %>
  <p>Iâ€™m a composer, software engineer, brewer, and sound designer living in Chicago.<p>
  <p>I believe strongly that the best ideas start from a simple, functional base and well-considered
  details, and I strive to bring this perspective to all of my work, be it a string quartet, an
  algorithm for destroying sound, or a crisp session IPA.</p>
